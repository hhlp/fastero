The code for this library is mostly well commented. If you still
have any questions or a problem, DM me on twitter_. I also maintain
a TODO.md file on the root of the repository and there may be open
issues in the github repository so you may want to check those out
if you are unsure on what to contribute

Why contribute?
---------------

Open source contribution can be an amazing learning experience.
It allows you to give back to and be a part of communities that
build valuable open source software. It enables you to make
software that you use, better.

How to contribute?
------------------

The most common form of contribution is code. However your
contributions do not have to be exclusive to code. You can
help by making comments on existing code and bugs, making
suggestions by creating an github issue, adding a new
gradient to the image export function. Or just tell others
about fastero.

If you want a guide on what each file in the codebase does
check out :doc:`Internal Structure <./internal_structure>`
