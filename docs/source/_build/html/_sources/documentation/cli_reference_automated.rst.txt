This is a automatically written CLI Reference.
It has exactly the same content as the ``--help`` parameter.
There also exists a hand-written CLI Reference at
:doc:`CLI Reference <./cli_reference>`.
This automated one is given because the hand-written one can
be outdated sometimes. The hand-written one is better than this
so you should try to use that over this whenever you can

This version does not have many examples. For examples see the hand-written version
